# React project - TIC-TAC-TOE
React practice project using new official tutorial https://react.dev/

With additional features:
1. For the current move only, now it shows “You are at move #…” instead of a button
2. Board was rewrote to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them
3. Toggle button added that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order
4. When someone wins, the three squares highlighted that caused the win (and when no one wins, it displays a message about the result being a draw)
5. Displaying the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list
