# React project - TIC-TAC-TOE
React practice project using new official tutorial https://react.dev/

Beginners concepts of React (theory, coding assignments) are finished, now it is time to practice

Updates:
1. For the current move only, now it shows “You are at move #…” instead of a button
2. Board was rewrote to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them
3. Toggle button added that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
4. When someone wins, the three squares highlighted that caused the win (and when no one wins, it displays a message about the result being a draw).
